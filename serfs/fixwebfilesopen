# This adds the necessary minimal .htaccess file to a web folder so all its files can be read
## The "URI web path" is relative to the www/html/ folder; it must already exist.

# How to use:
## ./fixwebfilesopen [URI web path]

# Eg:
## ./fixwebfilesopen inkisaverb.com/myfiles
## ./fixwebfilesopen newfiles.ink.verb.vip
