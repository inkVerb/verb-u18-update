# This runs installpostfix, installrc, and installpfa as one job
## Prerequisite: setupverb of course, and verbemail if you wish an email tld other than .email
## Check prerequisites for those

# OPTIONAL Prerequesite:
## If restoring from a backupvmail backup, the .vbak file must be in vip

# How to use:
## ./installvmail [RoundCube webmail path] [PostfixAdmin email pfa path - optional: if no other arguments and same as RoundCube] [PostfixAdmin setup secure option: "secure" otherwise use any other] [backup filename IF restoring from backupvmail backup, optional]

# Eg:
## ./installvmail roundcubesecretpath postfixadminsecretpath secure  # Secure, but no backup
## ./installvmail rcbase pfabase secure myemailfile.vbak # Backup and secure
## ./installvmail rcbase pfabase no myemailfile.vbak  # Backup, not secure
## ./installvmail rciscool pfarocks # Not secure, no backup
## ./installvmail vmailpath # Same path for RC and PFA, not secure, no backup

Everything looks good.
For setup, note:
- Use the install password 'inkverb77'
- Use any email you want admin, the admin password must include two numbers and two letters
- Then, login:
  - Add the domain: ${nameURI}
  - Create a user, such as me@${nameURI} etc
  - Use this new email and password to test the IMAP/SMTP connection in the third step of this next (webmail) setup process
Set up all this at:

 https://pfa.${emailTLDURI}/${PFA}/setup.php

- Then run ./postinstallpfa

Roundcube is ready to be installed at:

 https://rc.${emailTLDURI}/${RC}/installer

- Then run ./postinstallrc

Once all is set, you must restart the server in order for email boxes to send and receive.

For PostfixAdmin setup, note:
- You must create your own password on the Setup page, then add it via: setpfapass
  Then...
- Use any email you want admin, the admin password must include two numbers and two letters
- Then, login:
  - Add the domain: ${nameURI}
  - Create a user, such as me@${inkURI} etc
  - Use this new email and password to test the IMAP/SMTP connection in the third step of this next (webmail) setup process

Set up all this for PostfixAdmin at:
 https://pfa.${emailTLDURI}/${PFA}/setup.php

- Then run ./postinstallpfa

Roundcube is also ready to be installed at:
