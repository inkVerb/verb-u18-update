# This compresses a directory into a .tar.xz file, renamed as a .vtxz file, all in the PWD
## The resulting .vtxz file can simply be renamed to .tar.xz and be used accordingly
## This alternate extention name is intended to prevent tampering and to maintain consistency within inkVerb deployment

# The directory MUST be in the PWD!
# This will OVERWRITE any .vtxz destination file by the same name!

# How to use:
## ./vtxzin [directory]

# Eg:
## ./vtxzin mystuff
