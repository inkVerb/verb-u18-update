# This sets a new SSH login port number and disallows the previous port
## This could kill the current connection and require the user to logon again using the new port.
## The default for most servers is 22, this is to be different.
## Ghost uses 2368 by default, additional Gosts may use 2369 2370 etc. Avoid these.
## Even if not configured on this server, FTP tends to use 21 and hackers look for it. Avoid 21.
## Here is a list of common ports to avoid:
### 21 (FTP)
### 22 (SSH) - which this script changes
### 25 (SMTP)
### 80 (HTTP)
### 110 (POP3)
### 143 (IMAP)
### 443 (HTTPS)
### 465 (SMTPS)
### 993 (IMAPS)
### 995 (POP3S)
### 2368 (Ghost default) - Extra Ghost installs will incrementally rise above this.
### 8069 (Odoo default)

## This port will also be used by any FTP users, vips, or filers in an FTP app such as FileZilla.

# How to use:
## ./setport [port number]


# Include the config file
. /opt/verb/conf/siteport

NEWPORT=$1

sed -i "s/Port.*/Port ${NEWPORT}/g" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sed -i "s/SITEPORT.*/SITEPORT=\"${NEWPORT}\"/" /opt/verb/conf/siteport
ufw allow ${NEWPORT}
# Deny the previous port from the config file which has been written, but not yet refreshed
ufw deny ${SITEPORT}

# Reload the settings
systemctl reload ssh
